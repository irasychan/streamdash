## Architecture Decisions

1. **SSE over WebSocket** - Chose Server-Sent Events for server-to-client streaming since chat is primarily receive-only. Simpler than WebSocket and works well with Next.js API routes.

2. **Server-side platform connections** - All external connections (Twitch IRC, Discord Gateway, YouTube polling) happen on the server. This handles CORS, keeps tokens secure, and allows message normalization before broadcasting.

3. **Unified message format** - All platform messages normalized to a common `ChatMessage` type before being sent to clients.

4. **ConnectionManager singleton** - Central manager handles all platform connections and broadcasts to multiple SSE clients.

5. **Admin panel layout** - Chose shadcn sidebar component for consistent, accessible navigation with built-in mobile support and keyboard shortcuts.

### Dashboard Status Display Fix (Completed)
**Problem:** Dashboard always showed "Demo mode" even when Twitch API was working, because the status logic required **both** Twitch AND YouTube APIs to succeed before showing live status.

**Fix:** Updated `app/dashboard/page.tsx` to show granular status:
- "Live data" - both Twitch and YouTube APIs working
- "Twitch live · YouTube demo" - only Twitch API working
- "Twitch demo · YouTube live" - only YouTube API working  
- "Demo mode" - neither API working

Also improved Twitch auth status text for clarity.

### Header "Demo Mode" Bug (Completed)

**Problem:** Dashboard header always showed "Demo mode" in the top-right, even when APIs were working and the main page showed "Live data" or partial status.

**Root Cause:** Status was decoupled between components:
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` computed status from API calls but stored it in local state
- `DashboardLayoutClient` passed `status="Demo mode"` as a hardcoded default
- `DashboardHeader` received this default and never got updated

**Fix Implemented:** Created `DashboardStatusContext` to share status between page and header:

1. Created `contexts/DashboardStatusContext.tsx`:
   - Provider with `status`, `setStatus`, `isLive`, `setIsLive`
   - Exports `useDashboardStatus()` hook

2. Updated `DashboardLayoutClient`:
   - Wraps children in `DashboardStatusProvider`
   - Removed hardcoded status/isLive props

3. Updated `DashboardHeader`:
   - Uses `useDashboardStatus()` instead of props
   - Removed status/isLive props interface

4. Updated `app/dashboard/page.tsx`:
   - Uses `useDashboardStatus()` to read/write status
   - Sets `isLive` based on fetched stream status

**Files Created:**
- `contexts/DashboardStatusContext.tsx`

**Files Modified:**
- `components/dashboard-layout-client.tsx`
- `components/dashboard-header.tsx`
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx`

---

### Discord Channel Selection in Settings (Completed)
**Goal:** Allow users to browse and select Discord channels from the settings page instead of manually entering channel IDs.

**Implementation:**
- Integrated existing `DiscordChannelPicker` component into settings page
- Component provides: Discord auth status → Server dropdown → Channel browser
- Kept manual channel ID input as fallback option
- Displays selected channel ID after picking

**Rate Limit Handling (Extra):**
- Added HTTP 429 detection to `/api/discord/guilds` and `/api/discord/channels`
- Parses `Retry-After` header from Discord API responses
- Returns structured response: `{ ok: false, rateLimited: true, retryAfter: seconds }`
- Updated `DiscordChannelPicker` with countdown timer and auto-retry on rate limit
- Shows user-friendly message: "Rate limited. Retrying in Xs..."

**Files Modified:**
- `app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx` - Added DiscordChannelPicker import and integration
- `app/api/discord/guilds/route.ts` - Added rate limit handling
- `app/api/discord/channels/route.ts` - Added rate limit handling
- `components/DiscordChannelPicker.tsx` - Added retryCountdown state and auto-retry logic
