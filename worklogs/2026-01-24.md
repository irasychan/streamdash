### Visual Design Overhaul - Akira Neo Tokyo (Completed)

components/chat/PlatformBadge.tsx - Added glow effects
```

## Architecture Decisions

1. **SSE over WebSocket** - Chose Server-Sent Events for server-to-client streaming since chat is primarily receive-only. Simpler than WebSocket and works well with Next.js API routes.

2. **Server-side platform connections** - All external connections (Twitch IRC, Discord Gateway, YouTube polling) happen on the server. This handles CORS, keeps tokens secure, and allows message normalization before broadcasting.

3. **Unified message format** - All platform messages normalized to a common `ChatMessage` type before being sent to clients.

4. **ConnectionManager singleton** - Central manager handles all platform connections and broadcasts to multiple SSE clients.

5. **Admin panel layout** - Chose shadcn sidebar component for consistent, accessible navigation with built-in mobile support and keyboard shortcuts.
