## Completed Tasks

### Architecture Separation of Concerns
**Priority:** Medium

Migrated to feature-based architecture with clear separation of concerns.

**Final Directory Structure:**
```
features/               # Feature modules (top-level)
├── chat/
│   ├── components/     # ChatContainer, ChatMessage, ConnectionStatus, PlatformBadge
│   ├── hooks/          # useChatStatus
│   ├── types/          # ChatMessage, ChatPlatform, etc.
│   └── utils/          # emoteRenderer, youtubeTokenStore
├── emotes/
│   ├── hooks/          # useEmotes, useAutoLoadEmotes
│   └── types/          # ThirdPartyEmote, EmoteSource
├── config/
│   ├── useConfig.ts    # Client hook
│   └── types.ts        # StreamDashConfig schema
├── preferences/
│   ├── usePreferences.ts  # Client hook with theme application
│   └── types.ts           # UserPreferences, theme presets
├── widgets/
│   └── components/     # WidgetConfigCard, ChatWidgetConfigForm
└── dashboard/
    └── hooks/          # useDashboardStatus

services/               # External API clients (top-level, no React)
├── chat/
│   ├── ConnectionManager.ts
│   └── bridges/        # TwitchIRC, YouTubePoller, DiscordBridge
├── discord/
│   └── auth.ts
├── emotes/
│   └── thirdPartyEmotes.ts
└── widgets/
    └── urlGenerator.ts

state/                  # Zustand stores (top-level)
└── appStore.ts

server/                 # Server-only logic (top-level)
└── config.ts           # Config persistence

components/
├── layout/             # AppSidebar, DashboardHeader, DashboardLayoutClient
├── ui/                 # shadcn/ui primitives
└── [shared]/           # StatCard, DiscordChannelPicker

lib/                    # Cross-cutting utilities
└── shared/utils/cn.ts
```

**Subtasks Completed:**
- Mapped current folders/files to proposed layers
- Decided target structure (`features/`, `services/`, `state/`, `server/`)
- Identified quick wins (move low-risk modules first)
- Drafted migration steps for contexts → store(s)
- Updated import paths and aliases as needed
- Removed backwards-compatible re-exports after migration
- Moved feature UI components into feature modules
- Created components/layout/ for shared layout components
- Extracted services to top-level `services/`
- Moved state to top-level `state/`
- Created `server/` for server-only logic
- Verified build passes

### State Management Refactor
**Priority:** Medium

Reduced context provider nesting by migrating to Zustand.

**What was done:**
- Created `lib/state/appStore.ts` with Zustand store containing slices for:
  - Dashboard status (status string, isLive flag)
  - Chat status (connection state, polling, Twitch user lookup)
  - Emotes (third-party emotes with localStorage persistence)
- Created wrapper hooks: `useChatStatus`, `useDashboardStatus`, `useEmotes`
- Removed `ChatStatusContext` and `DashboardStatusContext`
- Removed provider nesting from `dashboard-layout-client.tsx`
- Preferences already use provider-free `useSyncExternalStore` pattern

**Subtasks Completed:**
- Documented research findings (`docs/research-state-management-refactor.md`)
- Audited current context providers and their dependencies
- Chose state management approach (Zustand)
- Migrated chat status state
- Migrated emote state
- Preferences state (already provider-free, no migration needed)
- Removed provider nesting from layouts
- Tested SSR compatibility (build passes)

### Widget Transparent Background Fix
**Priority:** Medium

Widget backgrounds are now transparent when loaded as OBS browser sources with `?transparent=true`.

**What was done:**
- Created `app/widgets/layout.tsx` - Applies transparent body styles when `transparent=true` param is set
- Added `.widget-transparent` CSS class in `globals.css` to override body background and `::before` gradient
- Updated all widget pages (chat, goal, stats) to support `transparent=true` URL param
- When transparent: removes Card backgrounds/borders/shadows, removes main padding

**Usage:**
```
/widgets/chat?transparent=true&twitchChannel=yourChannel
/widgets/goal?transparent=true&channel=yourChannel
/widgets/stats?transparent=true&channel=yourChannel
```

---

### Widget URL Param & Config Fixes
**Priority:** Medium

Fixed widget configuration URL generation and param handling.

**What was done:**
- Added `messageDensity` (Message Spacing) option to chat widget config
- Fixed `showAvatars` default mismatch between widget config (`false`) and ChatMessage fallback
- Updated chat widget page to read all display prefs from URL: `fontSize`, `messageDensity`, `showAvatars`, `showBadges`
- Fixed Tailwind config to scan `features/` directory (platform badge colors were being purged)
- Fixed Select component dropdown background (was transparent, now solid)

**URL params now supported:**
```
/widgets/chat?fontSize=small&messageDensity=compact&showAvatars=true&showBadges=false&transparent=true
```

---

### Settings Page Redesign
**Priority:** Low

Redesigned settings page with Monkeytype-inspired minimal UI.

**What was done:**
- Removed Appearance section (preferences now per-widget via URL params)
- Created collapsible Section component with chevron icons
- Created SettingRow component (label + description left, controls right)
- Created PillButton component for save/reset actions
- Sections: twitch, youtube, discord, goals, environment (collapsed), danger zone (collapsed)

---

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Feature-based architecture** - Organized code by feature domain rather than technical layer. Each feature contains its own components, hooks, types, and utils.

2. **Zustand for state management** - Chose Zustand over context providers for reduced boilerplate, better performance, and simpler mental model. Store is split into slices for organization.

3. **Services layer separation** - External API clients (TwitchIRC, YouTubePoller, DiscordBridge) moved to `services/` directory, keeping them free of React dependencies.

4. **Server-only config** - Configuration persistence logic moved to `server/` directory to clearly indicate server-only code that should not be imported by client components.
